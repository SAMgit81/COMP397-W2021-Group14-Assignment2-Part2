# COMP397-W2021-Group14-Assignment2-Part1

Repository for COMP397 W2020 Assignment 2 Part 1. Please read **IMPORTANT**.

## IMPORTANT

The way we have created and uploaded our repositories in the past was one repository per assignment part. Ideally, we would have a new repository called *COMP397-W2021-Group14-Assignment2-Part1*. However, this cannot be done, because we are over our data quota with Git, making it impossible to push via LFS for another 6 days (as of March 16) until the quota resets.

Since we don't really want to shell out $5 for another data block, for this submission, we will use the same repository from Assignment 1 Part 3, and archive the submission for that assignment part into a separate branch, called *Assignment1Part3*. Changes for Assignment 2 Part 1 will be pushed to the *main* branch as usual.
